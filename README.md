# custom-guideline-matcher

To use this, create a .env file in the root directory and mention the OpenAI key here

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-1kdah321"
```

Then you can set the constant values in the `guideline_proposer_standalone.py` script based on your configuration and run the script directly to get the results.
